### Journal

* In class Kaleb and I worked out a basic plan which was, Kaleb does the report and I do the wireframes. Then Clinton was added to the group, he was to help with ideas for wireframes and add to report. 

* We have communicated over slack with updates, when report was finished, repository was created and wireframes completed.
