### Journal

* In class Kaleb and I worked out a basic plan which was, Kaleb does the report and I do the wireframes. Then Clinton was added to the group, he was to help with ideas for wireframes and add to report. 

* We have communicated over slack with updates, when report was finished, repository was created and wireframes completed.

### Report 

* The bug feature I have choosen is when the programme is started it should bring up the home page with the smiley face world image, this is showen in the wireframes. By fixing this bug the app becomes self explanatory and doesnt leave the user woundering what it does.
